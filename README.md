# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š LlamaIndex - Chat with the Streamlit docs

Build a chatbot powered by LlamaIndex that augments GPT 3.5 with the contents of the Streamlit docs (or your own data).

## Overview of the App

<img src="app.png" width="75%">

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a chat engine that will retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query

## Demo App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://llamaindex-chat-with-docs.streamlit.app/)

## Get an OpenAI API key

You can get your own OpenAI API key by following the following instructions:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
2. Click on the `+ Create new secret key` button.
3. Next, enter an identifier name (optional) and click on the `Create secret key` button.
4. Once you have your API key, you will need to store this in .streamlit/secrets.toml. IF this file doesnt exist, create it with the following
```openai_key = "your-key-here-AND-MAKE-SURE-TO-ADD-FILE-TO-GITIGNORE"```

> [!CAUTION]
> You **NEED** to add ```.streamlit/secrets.toml``` to your .gitignore. Head over to the projects .gitignore and uncomment it.

## Try out the app

Once the app is loaded, enter your question about the Streamlit library and wait for a response.
